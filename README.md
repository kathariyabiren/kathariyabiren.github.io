## Experience
**RESEARCH ASSISTANT, MCC LAB, UMKC (AUGUST 2016-PRESENT)**
- The key responsibilities are to conduct research on different topics related to multimedia computation and compression under the supervision of Professor Zhu Li.

**MEDIATEK, SAN JOSE, CA (INTERNSHIP, JUNE 2017- JULY 2017)**
- Implement tiled based 360o video player on web-browser that should support MPEG-DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) SRD (Spatial Relationship Descriptor)

**FUTUREWEI TECH. INC., SAN JOSE, CA (INTERNSHIP, JUNE 2018- DEC 2018)**
- Made a contribution to G-PCC (Geometry Based Point Could Compression), a point cloud compression standard developed by MPEG-PCC for static and LiDAR dataset. The contribution “Binary-tree based level-of-details generation for attributes coding in G-PCC” got adopted in the tmc13v5 standard.

**TENCENT AMERICA, PALO ALTO, CA (INTERNSHIP, MAY 2019- AUGUST 2019)**
- Worked on inter-version of G-PCC (Inter-EM) which is an exploratory model for point cloud compression for frame-based point cloud. The idea was to exploit both geometry as well as the attribute values to search the matching block in the reference frame.

**QUALCOMM, SAN DIEGO, CA (INTERNSHIP, AUGUST 2021- JANUARY 2022)**
- Worked on Learning-based In-loop filter for VVC (Versatile Video Coding). Utilized CNN and Transformers to design learned In-loop filter.

**QUALCOMM, SAN DIEGO, CA (INTERNSHIP, AUGUST 2022- SEPTEMBER 2023)**
- Worked on deriving the angular parameters of KITTI dataset for optimal compression with G-PCC.
